Queue application

To compile:
g++ -pthread game.cpp queue.cpp

This program will ask the user to answer math questions (add, sub, mult, div).
The queue will have 3 questions before the game starts. After the game starts, a new question
will be added every 1 second if the level is 5, 2 seconds if the level is 4, .. 5 seconds if the level is 1.
The user will be asked to choose a level from 1 to 5 before the game starts.
A question for the user to answer will be removed from the front of the queue. The user will be asked to answer
the same question until he gives the correct answer. After he gives a correct answer, the next question will be removed from the front of
the queue.

When the queue grows to have 10 questions (the queue is full), the game ends and the user loses (he was too slow doing the math). 
When the queue becomes empty, the game ends and the user wins (he was quick doing the math).
When the user answers 100 questions correctly, the game ends and the user wins (the queue never became empty or full).

This program uses one thread to add new questions to the queue and another to let the user 
enter math questions.
